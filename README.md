# Bike Sharing
This project is based on the prediction of demand for a bike-sharing provider company. Here, we have analyzed the driving factors behind the demand which can be utilized by the company to meet the demand.

## General Information
- A US bike-sharing provider "BoomBikes" wants to understand the factors on which the demand for their shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.
- The project will be helping the company in taking correct data-driven decisions to meet the demand.
- The company has suffered considerable dips in its revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain itself in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end. Here,  I have built a model for the prediction of the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand the variables that are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes and How well those variables describe the bike demands. So, They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 
- For this analysis, based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the company has provided a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market.

## Conclusions
- There are total 11 number of predictors which affects the demand of the bike.
- Top three predictors which affect demand the most are Temperature, Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds and Year.
- Predictors which negatively affect the demand are Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds, windspeed and Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist.
